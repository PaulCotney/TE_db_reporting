Glossary from page
-----------------------
chromo,pos: location of TE
strand: orientation of TE
distance: distance from current TE to next TE
ref_te: 1 if TE is also in reference otherwise 0
state: 
	fixed - TE is in everyone, (almost everyone), 
	shared - only in a subset
	private - present in only one strain/sample
	private? - present in only one strain/sample but does not have enough reads to support
	singleton - TE is present in only one sample and no other sample with the same haplotype is available in that location
before: reference sequence before the TE
after: reference sequence after the TE
genotype: 
	if shared or fixed: genotype of samples who has TE in that location
	if private or singleton: name of the sample then followed by its genotype in parenthesis. Name is shortened for CC
From column J to EU:
	 0: has nonTE-like sequence only
	 1: has TE-like sequence only
	 2: has both nonTE-like, and TE-like sequence, and sample is het for TE, not for multiple founder
	 3: has both nonTE-like, and TE-like sequence, and sample has two different founders in that location
	-1: does not have any count: either has low coverage, deletion or algorithmic fault

my_id: class of TE that is found in that location
region:
	exon: if TE is in exon
	intron: if TE is in gene but not in exon
	promoter: if TE is not in gene but within 1000base from transcription binding site
	intergenic: if TE is neither in gene, nor in promoter
	regions left to the double vertical bars have the same orientation as TE
		If there are multiple regions in this left side, then they will be seperated by one vertical bars.
	regions right to the double vertical bars have the opposite orientation as TE
		If there are multiple regions in this right side, then they will be seperated by one vertical bars.

gene_id:
	ID of gene if TE is not intergenic
	IDs left to double vertical bars have the same orientation as TE
		if there are multiple IDs in this group then they are seperated by one vertical bar
	IDs right to double vertival bars have the opposite orientation as TE
		if there are multiple IDs in this group then they are seperated by one vertical bar

gene_name:
	Name of gene if TE is not intergenic
	Name left to double vertical bars have the same orientation as TE
		if there are multiple names in this group then they are seperated by one vertical bar
	Name right to double vertival bars have the opposite orientation as TE
		if there are multiple names in this group then they are seperated by one vertical bar
